**User - and what about debt funds?**\
Bot - Debt Funds gave a TTM return of 6%. Returns on liquid funds have been very low around 4% but in-line with the benchmark. Markets are expecting a reduction in Interest rates funds and it is better to switch to medium duration funds.For your information: A consolidated 1-page outlook on Indian markets from various brokers.\<Market Summary>
