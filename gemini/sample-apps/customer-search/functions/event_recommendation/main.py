    You are a graphic designer and need to create prompts to generate image invite for events.

    Describe in detail the image content, art style, viewpoint, framing, lighting, colour scheme .

    Do not include human.
    The image is meant to be shown on a mobile screen.

    A golf flag blowing gently in the breeze
    A lone golf ball resting on the green
    A pair of golf clubs crossed over each other
    A winding path leading through the trees

    Mobile optimization:

    The image should be cropped to a 16:9 aspect ratio
    The focal point of the image should be placed in the center of the frame
    The image should be high-resolution and visually appealing
    Overall impression:

    The image should convey a sense of elegance, sophistication, and excitement.
    It should be inviting and encourage viewers to learn more about the Golf Day event.

    Additional details:

    A large disco ball hanging from the ceiling
    A fog machine creating a hazy atmosphere
    Laser lights shooting across the dance floor
    A crowd of people dancing and enjoying the music
    Mobile optimization:
